5. Click the "Tell me about the invoice" button to get the AI-generated response

## Configuration

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key for accessing Gemini Pro Vision

Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: The user uploads an invoice image through the Streamlit interface.

2. **Question Input**: The user enters a question about the invoice content.

3. **AI Processing**: 
   - The application sends the image and question to Google's Gemini Pro Vision AI.
   - Gemini analyzes the image content and generates a response based on the question.

4. **Result Display**: The AI-generated response is displayed to the user in the Streamlit interface.
